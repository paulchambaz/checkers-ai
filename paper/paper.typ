    This project was conducted as part of the _Artificial Intelligence_ course,
    taught by _Elise Bonzon_, within the third-year undergraduate curriculum at
    _Paris Cit√© University_. The primary objective of this project is to develop
    an artificial intelligence capable of solving two-player games by
    implementing the alpha-beta algorithm. The project aims to explore this
    algorithm in order to create an AI capable of competing against players of
    varying skill levels. Checkers was chosen as the game of focus due to its
    strategic complexity despite simple rules and the variety of evaluation
    methods available for a given position.

= Description of the game and program

== Motivation

In this project, we have chosen checkers as our game for investigation.
This decision was influenced by multiple factors. First and foremost,
checkers is relatively simple to implement, enabling us to concentrate on
the essential aspects of our algorithm rather than the game's complexity.
Nevertheless, despite its apparent simplicity, checkers possesses
considerable strategic depth. Although it may not be on par with the
intricacies of classic games such as chess or go, checkers boasts a
potential move count of approximately $5 times 10^20$. It was not until
1994 that a checkers algorithm secured the world champion title for this
game, and a comprehensive solution was not achieved until 2007. To this
day, checkers is the most complex game that has been fully solved.

Secondly, in contrast to other projects considered, checkers emerged as a
fertile domain for the diverse methods employed in evaluation functions.
When observing an ongoing game, it appears relatively straightforward to
assess the strength of a player's position. While this type of judgment is
inadequate for analyzing high-level play, it is probable that the
evaluation function required for the alpha-beta pruning algorithm permits a
more inventive and effective solution.

Lastly, during our research on this topic, we uncovered the importance of
checkers in the history of artificial intelligence. As early as 1952, a
preliminary algorithm was developed. In 1959, the first paper to use the
term _Machine Learning_ was titled _"Some Studies in Machine Learning Using
the Game of Checkers"_ @samuel59. Furthermore, with the _Chinook_
@schaeffer96 program, checkers has been entirely solved by artificial
intelligence since 2007. This more modest project will focus exclusively on
the application of alpha-beta pruning.

== Rules of checkers

Checkers is played on an eight-by-eight square board, comprising two types
of squares: white and black. Throughout the game, pieces can only move on
the black squares. The game involves two players, one controlling the white
pieces and the other the black pieces.

At the beginning of the game, each player recieves twelve pawns that are
placed on the black squares within the first three rows. Only the two
middle rows are empty at the game's commencement, and the white player
initiates play.

In checkers, a piece may only move diagonally and proceed to an unoccupied
black square. If a piece occupies a square, it is not possible to move to
that square. Once a piece has moved, it becomes the other player's turn. A
pawn can only advance forward.

A pawn can capture an ennemy piece by _jumping_ over it and landing on the
diagonal square beyond the pawn. If this square is occupied, the pawn
cannot move there and is unable to capture the enemy piece. If it can, the
enemy piece is removed from the board, rendering it unusable by the
opponent. Moreover, a pawn must capture if it can; if multiple options are
available, the player can choose which pawn to capture. Additionally, a
pawn may execute a chain capture: if, after capturing, a pawn can capture
again immediately, it must do so. The opponent's turn is delayed until the
pawn can no longer capture.

A pawn can become a king when it reaches the opponent's back row. Upon
promotion, the pawn transforms into a king, which is a highly powerful
piece in the game of checkers. First, it can move in all directions.
Second, it can advance as many unoccupied squares as desired. Lastly, after
capturing, it can land on any available square beyond the captured piece.
This makes a king an extremely agile piece capable of easily capturing
multiple pawns when left unprotected. After promotion, the turn passes to
the opponent, even if the kind might be able to capture additional pieces.

The game can end for two reasons : if a player has no pieces remaining or
no valid moves, they lose. A draw can also occur if the same sequence
happens three times in a row, in an ABABAB pattern, or if no piece has
captured in the last 32 turns.

== Program description

For this project, we opted to utilize the _Lisp_ programming language, as
it was the original language developed for artificial intelligence. Lisp's
grammar is often characterized as _meta-programmable_, and a _functional
language_, we believed it would be conducive to implementing mathematical
concepts. Moreover, the _Lisp_ dialect we employed, _Common Lisp_, along
with the graphical library _SDL2_ for displaying the game, are highly
performant and can facilitate extensive search depth. The program is
organized into seperate sub-files for ease of maintenance:

- `main.lisp`: Contains the main loop of the program, setting up SDL2 and
  enabling the human versus machine gameplay.
- `logic.lisp`: Contains the complete set of rules for the game of
  checkers. This file implements state, action, result, actions and
  terminal-test.
- `intelligence.lisp`: Contains all functions related to artificial
  intelligence, including minimax and utility, as well as the functions
  used to create the endgame database.
- `training.lisp`: Contains all functions utilized for training the
  program.
- `interface.lisp`: Contains the code responsible for displaying the
  program to the user.
- `constants.lisp`: Contains various values used across the program.
- `package.lisp`: Contains information about the package.

= Artificial Intelligence Description

==  Chinook

Before delving into the description of our program, it is essential to
establish the state of the art. The primary program that achieved what we
are attempting is called _Chinook_ @schaeffer96. This program is renowned
for defeating the world champion in 1994. However, it is worth noting that
it accomplished this without beating the legendary champion _Marion
Tinsley_, who remained undefeated for over 40 years. Unfortunately, Tinsely
passed away in 1994, never have been defeated. In 2007, researchers from
the _University of Alberta_ unveiled the results of their work: checkers
was now a conquered game, and the outcome of perfect play was a draw. Our
program is considerably simpler, but there are still insights we can glean
from Chinook. Accustomed to the state of modern artificial intelligence
with deep neural networks, such as _Deep Blue_, which defeated _Garry
Kasparov_ in 1997, we were intrigued to discover that _Chinook_ employs
techniques strikingly similar to our program. Chinook uses an opening
database, crafter from the analysis of expert players. It then applies
minimax for the middle game, with the evaluation function designed by an
expert player to achieve optimal performance. Lastly, the researchers
develoed an engame database, enabling _Chinook_ to determine, for every
position, whether it will result in a win, loss or draw, and the
appropriate move to execute.

== Program PEAS

Before initiating our program, it is crucial to define its PEAS
(Performance measure, Environment, Actuators and Sensors). Our agent type
is a checkers program, with the performance measure being the AI's strength
against human players. The environment encompasses the checkers board and
the game's rules. The actuators is straighforward : the AI communicates the
move it intends to make, and a human operator can then execute the
corresponding move in a real game. If the game is entirly computer-based,
the AI has the capacity to play the move it has chosen. As the AI lacks
real-world sensors, the game's state must be described within the computer,
but once this is accomplished, the AI can utilize its internal
representation of the state.

This environment is *fully observable*, as the AI can, in theory, explore
all possible states. It is a *single-agent* environment since the AI
competes against a human opponent. The environment is *deterministic*, as
an action performed on a given state will consistently result in the same
state. It is *episodic*, as there is a clear progression to the game, with
actions taken in one turn affect subsequent turns. The environment is
static, as it does not change unless an action is decided upon and executed
by the AI or the player during their respective turns. Lastly, since the
game is turn-based, it is *discrete*.

== Formal definition of a state

We will begin by providing a formal definition of a state, which much
encapsulate all the necessary information required to make informed decisions
about future gameplay. As this state will be passed to the search tree, it is
preferable to have a simpler state rather than a more complex one. In this
project, we have chosen to represent the state in the following manner:

- The list of the values of the squares on the board, where `0` means
  empty, `1` means a white pawn, `2` means a black pawn, `3` means a white
  king and `4` means a black king. It should be noted that both
  black and white pieces are stored in this for convenience, though this
  incurs a memory cost.
- The number of the player who must act, with `0` for white and `1` for
  black.
- The number of the square where a player is required to capture an
  opponent's piece. As stated in the rules, sometimes a player must
  continue capturing pieces. In such cases, the number of its position will
  be stored; if no piece is required to capture another, then `-1` will be
  stored.
- The list of the last six actions performed. This list is used to
  determine games that end in draws.
- The countdown until the game is declared a draw, which resets to 32 every
  time a piece captures another.

In a more formal manner, we define :

$ n in NN, S_n in SS $

Where $n$ is the turn of the game, $S_n$ is the state, and $EE$ is the space
of all possible states.

== Formal definition of an action

An action represents a single movement by a player, meaning that chained
actions are depicted as multiple actions. The approach allows the search
tree to choose the best combination of actions. An action is composed of:

- The square from which the action starts.
- The square to which the action moves.
- The index of the player who will play after the current turn is
  completed, with `0` for white and `1` and black.
- The index of the piece that has been eaten, `-1` when none.

In a more formal manner, we define :

$ a in AA $
$ u : AA times SS -> SS, (a, S_n) |-> S_(n+1) $
$ v : SS -> AA^m, S_n |-> {a_1, .. ,a_m} $

Where $AA$ represents the space of actions. $u$ is the result function, a
function that takes an action and a state and returns the new state.
Finally, $v$ is the actions function, which takes a state and returns the
list of legal actions. We will use the functions for searching. The new
list of states to search can be expressed concisely. Moreover, this
relation is recursive.

$ forall E_n, forall a in v(E_n), u(a, E_n) $

== Evaluation Function

The evaluation function is crucial for creating a robust program. If we do
not have a clear understanding of a state's quality, searching through
thousands of them will not be very helpful. In this program, we define the
evaluation function as follows:

$ f : EE -> RR, E_n |-> f(E_n) $
$ f(E_n) = w_1 times f_1(E_n) + ... + w_p times f_p(E_n) $
$ W = vec(w_1, w_2, dots.v, w_p) $

Our evaluation function is essentially a composition of $p$ sub-functions.
All these sub-functions are sub-evaluation functions that each measure an
atomic observation of the state. Once all these observations are made, we
combine them with weights stored in the vector $W$. The various
sub-functions are unbiased, meaning they can return observations that might
be considerd good, such as the number of pieces the player has, or they can
return observations that might be considered bad, such as the number of
pieces the opponent has. The weights role is to determine which information
is good and which is bad, and to assign weights to those judgments, hence
the name. Later on, we will address the questions of determining the best
or at least very strong set of weights, as well as identifying which
observations are useful, good, or bad, and which are not really significant
factors.

This is the list of all evaluation function, seperated in categories:

- *Simple counts:*
  - The number of pawns for the player.
  - The number of pawns for the opponent.
  - The number of checkers for the player.
  - The number of checkers for the opponent.

- *Mobility counts:*
  - The mobility for the player.
  - The mobility for the opponent.
  - The eating mobility for the player.
  - The eating mobility for the opponent.

- *Positional counts:*
  - The piece count in the center for the player.
  - The piece count in the center for the opponent.
  - The piece count in the front for the player.
  - The piece count in the front for the opponent.
  - The piece count in the back for the player.
  - The piece count in the back for the opponent.
  - The piece count in the left for the player.
  - The piece count in the left for the opponent.
  - The piece count in the right for the player.
  - The piece count in the right for the opponent.
  - The piece count in the sides for the player.
  - The piece count in the sides for the opponent.
  - The piece count in the diagonal for the player.
  - The piece count in the diagonal for the opponent.

== Optimization of Minimax Algorithm in Checkers

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making strategy widely employed in
two-player games, including checkers, to determine the optimal move. While
the alpha-beta pruning technique significantly enhances the effiency of the
minimax algorithm, additional optimization methods can be employed to
improve its speed even further. In this paper, we discuss the
implementation of an iterative deepening algorithm and move ordering
techniques to optimize the performance of the minimax algorithm in
checkers.

The iterative deepening algorithm is a depth-first strategy that
iteratively explores states at increasing depths. This method offers three
key advantages. By setting a time limit, the search process can be
terminated if the time budget is exceeded, ensuring consistent playing
speed and an improved user experience. If a guaranteed win or loss is
found, there is no need to search deeper or for other move combinations.
The iterative deepening algorithm allows for the collection of data on
useful moves, resulting in a substantial speedup when combined with move
ordering techniques.

Move ordering techniques help to explore promising moves first, thereby
improving the efficiency of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
We discuss three move ordering techniques. 

With piece move ordering, kings are prioritized over pawns, and forward
pieces are prioritized over backward ones. This simple optimization
frequently helps identify strong moves on the first attempt.

A frequency table involves creating a hashmap that records the number of
times each move hsa cut off minimax in alpha-beta pruning. Moves are then
sorted by the frequency in the hashmap, enabling the exploration of more
promising moves first. By ranking moves according to their pruning
frequency, the search process is guided towards branches that are more
likely to yield optimal results. The frequency table allows the algorithm
to learn from previous search iterations and capitalize on this information
to make more informed decisions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the
minmax search.

Killer moves heuristics is another strong method. Building upon the
frequency table, killer moves heuristics store moves that cut off minimax
for each depth and player in the search tree. These moves are considered
highly promising and are prioritized in the search process. The underlying
result in a cutoff at a specific depth in the search tree, it is likely to
cause a cutoff at the same dpeth in other parts of the tree. By identifying
and prioritzing such killer moves are store for each depth of the search
tree, ensuring that the most promising moves are consistently prioritized
throughout the search.

The combination of these optimization techniques has proven to yield
significant improvements in the performance of the minimax algorithm for
checkers.

== Construction of an opening database

Although alpha-beta pruning is highly effective at identifying strong moves,
it does have certain limitations. One such limitation is its inability to
dicern the superiority of a move if the advantage is not immediately apparent.
This can lead to suboptimal performance in games with less obvious evaluation
criteria. Another consequence of this limitation is that the impact of small
action taken at the beginning of the game may not be recognized until much
later in the game, sometimes as many as 50 turns later.

To address this issue, we have implemented an opening database for our
checkers program. The opening database is a simple hashtable that stores game
states that may arise early in the game as keys, with the corresponding moves
to play as values. Before the program begins the iterative minimax search, it
checks the opening database and plays a move from it if available. This
approach helps guide the program to make stronger opening moves that may have
long-term consequences not easily detected by the minimax algorithm with
alpha-beta pruning.

In the absense of access to expert checkers players or a large dataset of
expert games, we built our opening database using Chinook, which is widely
considered the strongest checkers player. By comparing the initial moves made
by our program to those played by Chinook, we observed differences that
suggest the opening database has a positive impact on the overall performance
of our program. Utilizing the opening database should lead to more accurate
play and improved results on average.

== Construction of an endgame database

Another limiation of the minimax algorithm is that the search must eventaully
come to an end, either due to reaching a specified depth or exceeding the
allocated time. When this occurs, the algorithm returns an evaluation of the
game state. However, when there are only a few pieces remaining on the board,
it is possible to precompute the game's outcome and provide the corresponding
outcome to the algorithm. This enables the program to return the most suitable
action without conducting the search if the game state has already been
determined.

This approach is known as an endgame database and was used effectively by
Chinook to solve checkers. Chinook's success hinged on the creation of a large
endgame database, which encompasses all possible states with ten pieces
remaining on the board. Since then, the checkers endgame database has expanded
to included up to twelve pieces. To create our own endgame database, we had to
enumerate all possible states, eliminate duplicates, and compute the final
result for each state. This process can be conducted iteratively, allowing the
addition of results fo reach piece layer to the algorithm for faster
performance. In this project, we successfully built a two-piece database, which
significanly accelerates and improves the precision of endgame scenarios. If
the minimax algorithm reaches a state where a guaranteed win has been
precomputed, the AI is certain never to lose, which is a powerful outcome. To
make this process go faster, we implemented parallelism.

Out initial goal was to build a four-piece endgame database, but memory
constaints prevented us from achieving this within the given time.
Additionally, the complexity of certain positions meant that we could not
reach the end state for all of the states in the two-piece database. Out of
approximately 35000 positions considered, only 32000 were completely solved in
our computations. Desplite these limitations, loading the resulting database
at runtime provides an additional twelve levels of depth for endgame positions
where a computed state is reached. Considering that we often achieve a depth
of ten during endgame scenarios, this translates to a function depth of over
20, greatly enhancing the performance of our checkers program.


== Tournament between AI

In the context of our checkers program, while the opening and endgame states
are addressed through specific databases, the middle game remains a crucial
component in determining the outcome. The middle game often decides the
majority of checkers matches, making it essential to devise the most effective
evaluation function possible. Although increasing search depth can improve
performance, the key factor lies in accurately evaluating a given state. As
mentioned earlier, we can simplify our evaluation into a vector $W$ of
weights. To find the best evaluation function, we aim to identify $W$ that
maximiezes the number of games won, transforming the problem into an
optimization task where we search a space. To tackle this issue, we employed a
genetic algorithm.

The process begins by generating an initial population of 40 vectors, which we
refer to as AIs and imagine them competing in a tournament. The starting
values can either be random or pretrained, and in this project, we opted for
biasing them in hopes of achieving faster or better solutions. This decision
was also influenced by the high dimensionality of the vector space, which
chould lead to chaotic results. With the initial population established, the
AIs are pitted against one another in matches.

After each match, we update the AI's ELO rating and im to pair AIs with
opponent of similar ratings for improved accuracy. Once the matches are
completed, we use the ELO ratings to generate a new population. AIs with
higher ELO rating are more likely to be included in the next generation.

The new generation is created through a three-step process : selecting two
parents based on their ELO ratings, mixing their weights around a point
determined by their ELO ratio and creating a new AI from the concatenated
parts of each parent. To ensure diversity in the new generation, we make
slight adjustments to each of the resulting weights. This approach is heavily
inspired by the biological process of DNA recombination. Though articial
selection imposed by the fitness constraint of the ELO ratings, our program
progressively generates stronger AIs.

We applied this method for a total of 150 generations, with each generation
consisting of 40 AIs that played 5 games each. This amounted to a total of
30000 games in pursuit of the best possible checkers player.

== Writing AI for humans

While developing a strong AI is a noteworthy achievement, it may not
necessarily result in an engaging experience for human players. An AI that
defeats most players, including experts, like Chinook, can lack a human touch
and be less enjoyable to play against. To address this issue, we implemented
different difficulty levels to cater to various player skill levels and ensure
a more enjoyable gaming experience. The three basic difficulty levels are as
follows:

- *Easy:* This AI has a depth limit of 4 and uses manually set weights. It
  provides a suitable challenge for beginners or casual players who want a
  more relaxed game.
- *Medium:* For this level, we used the weights from our hard AI to generate a
  new population of AIs. We mutated each weight slightly using a Gaussian
  distribution, then conducted a final tournament for the AIs to determine the
  rankings. To find the AI that best matched a medium skill level, we utilized
  human-assisted binary search, having family members play against the AIs.
  The resulting AI was chosen as the medium difficulty AI, with a search time
  of 3 seconds. This level is suitable for intermediate players who want a
  more challenging but still manageable opponent.
- *Hard:* The hard AI incorporates all the strategies and techniques we've
  developed throughout the project. It utilizes the best AI from our training
  process, the opening and endgame databases, and searches for 10 seconds
  before delivering a move. This level is designed for advanced players who
  want to face a formidable opponent and test their skills to the fullest
  extent.

By incorporating these difficulty levels, our checkers program provides a more
balanced and enjoyable experience for human players with varying skill levels,
ensuring that the game remains engaging and entertaining.

= Conclusion

We take great pride in the results of this project and appreciate the wealth
of knowledge gained troughout its development. The code has been released under
a free software license, enabling others to learn from it and attempt to
defeat our hard AI. Key challenges included optimizing the algorithm by
thoroughly understanding its inner workings, building the endgame database by
iterating through all valid game states, and optaining the best AI through the
time-consuming process of simulating games with the genetic algorithm.

Future improvements could involve more extensive training or the incorporation
of advanced techniques like neural networks to enhance the evaluation
function. Rewriting the program in a lower-level language, such as C, may also
yield deeper search capabilities. Furthermore, we did not use parallelism to
train the genetic algorithm, or for parallel seaching which could result in
improved depth.

We would like to express our gratitude to Elise Bonzon for offering the course
and providing valuable guidance throughout the project, as well as our
families for their support.
